# cpp-micrograd
Inspired by [@karpathy's - micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

Autograd engine is the technical implementation of backpropogation algorithm that allows neural nets to learn.
And micrograd is the simplest implementation of the autograd engine, but.. its only in python.

This is a simple re-implementation of micrograd using cpp.
It was made with the major intention for personal learning. So..

### Who will find this repo useful?
1. If you love micrograd, but would wanna also have a cpp version for it.
2. If you want a crisp backprop theory and annotated code of the autograd engine. 
3. If you wanna learn cpp by building neural nets, then this could be a good start (it was my purpose).

### TODO: Notable insightful material:
1. `cpp-micrograd/digin` will consist of annotated version of the code. It will dive deep into seemingly complex cpp keywords and design. Through that you can get a deeper understanding of cpp and design choices made.
2. `digin-micrograd-theory` will consist of fundamental "to-the-point" theory behind autograd. It's based on Karpathy's explanation, customized for getting started with this repository.

### Contributions
I am also a novice cpp programmer, so my implementations can be very sub-optimal.
To make this repository actually useful, it will definitely need contributions from anyone who can make any part better.
So we will have open contributions for anyone interested.
So feel free to add a PR/issue, it is free-form for now.
